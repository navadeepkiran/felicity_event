# Q&A Clarifications Verification

## ✅ FIXED ISSUES

### 1. Event Status Auto-Update ✅
**Q&A Requirement:** "Ensure that whenever an event is displayed, its status is determined by comparing the current time with the event's scheduled start and end times."

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Added `getCurrentStatus()` method to Event model
- ✅ Added pre-save hook to auto-update status
- ✅ Browse events route now auto-updates status before sending response
- ✅ Event details route auto-updates status
- ✅ Organizer dashboard auto-updates status

**Logic:**
```javascript
- Before eventStartDate → 'published'
- During event (start to end) → 'ongoing'  
- After eventEndDate → 'completed'
- Draft stays draft
- Closed stays closed
```

### 2. Cascade Delete for Organizers ✅
**Q&A Requirement:** "When organizer is permanently deleted by admin, you need to delete all data associated with it"

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Admin DELETE route now supports `?permanent=true` query parameter
- ✅ Permanent deletion deletes:
  - All events created by organizer
  - All registrations for those events
  - The organizer account itself
- ✅ Soft delete (default) just sets `isActive: false`

**Usage:**
```
DELETE /api/admin/clubs/:clubId              → Deactivate (soft delete)
DELETE /api/admin/clubs/:clubId?permanent=true → Permanently delete with cascade
```

### 3. Filter Inactive Organizers' Events ✅
**Issue:** Events from deactivated clubs were still visible in browse

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Browse events route now filters to show only events from active organizers
- ✅ Followed clubs filter also respects active status
- ✅ Clubs list endpoint only returns active clubs
